## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Migrate user-facing terminology from "agent" to "droid" across commands, skills, droid prompts, templates, plugin metadata, and documentation surfaces.
- Keep technical internals stable (e.g. package identifiers) while updating wording and installer expectation to "Multi-Droid Orchestration".
